|:------------|:------------|
| n1 -ne n2   | check if n1 is equals to n2 |
| n1 -eq n2   | check if n1 is not equal to n2 |
| n1 -ge n2   | check if n1 is greater or equals to n2 |
| n1 -gt n2   | check if n1 is greater than to n2 |
| n1 -le n2   | check if n1 is less or equals to n2 |
| n1 -lt n2   | check if n1 is less than to n2 |

## STRING COMPARISON

| s1 = s2     | check if s1 is equals to s2 |
| s1 != s2    | check if s1 is not equals to s2 |
| s1 > s2     | check if s1 is greater than (alphabetic order) to s2 |
| s1 < s2     | check if s1 is less than (alphabetic order) to s2 |
| -n s1       | check if s1 has size greater than 0, check if is not empty |
| -z s1       | check if s1 has size equal to 0, check if is empty |
