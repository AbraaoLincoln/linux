# Bash Customization

The variable PS1 founded in the file .bashrc contains a string with the format of the string that appears on the terminal

```
# the variable PS1 define its format
user@host:~/document $
```
After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the promptvars shell option.

The enviroment variable PROMPT_COMMAND can be use to have a dynamic prompt, it store a command that gets excuted just before the prompt is printed. So we can use it to set a new value to the PS1 variable.

```
\[color_code\]text
```

The text(foreground) color code can have two values separated with _;_ , the one on the left side is to determine the the format of the text like normal text or bold, on the right hand side the color of the text, like:
